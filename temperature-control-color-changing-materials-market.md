<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Temperature Control Color Changing Materials Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reversible Thermochromic Materials</li><li>Irreversible Thermochromic Materials</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Temperature control color-changing materials can be divided into two main types: reversible thermochromic materials and irreversible thermochromic materials. Reversible thermochromic materials change color temporarily when exposed to heat, and revert back to their original color when cooled. These materials are often used in products like mood rings and thermometers. On the other hand, irreversible thermochromic materials permanently change color when heated, making them suitable for applications like temperature indicators in packaging or safety labels. Both types play a crucial role in various industries for temperature monitoring and visual indication purposes.</p></p>
