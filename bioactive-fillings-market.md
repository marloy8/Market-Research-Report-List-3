<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bioactive Fillings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Fillings</li><li>Indirect Fillings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Direct fillings are bioactive materials placed directly into a cavity in a single visit and set quickly. They include materials like glass ionomer cements and composite resins. Indirect fillings, on the other hand, are fabricated outside the mouth and then bonded or cemented into place in a subsequent visit. Examples of indirect fillings include inlays, onlays, and crowns made from bioactive materials like ceramics or zirconia. Both types of fillings provide bioactive properties such as remineralization and antimicrobial effects for improved oral health.</p></p>
