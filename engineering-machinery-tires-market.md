<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Engineering Machinery Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bias Tire</li><li>Radial Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Engineering machinery tires are divided into two main types: bias tires and radial tires. Bias tires are constructed with multiple layers of fabric crisscrossed at a specific angle, providing stability and durability. They are more commonly used in older machinery and in applications where cost is a major factor. Radial tires have a more advanced construction with layers running perpendicular to the tread, allowing for improved performance, fuel efficiency, and ride comfort. They are typically found in newer machinery and are preferred for heavy-duty applications.</p></p>
