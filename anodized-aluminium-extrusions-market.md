<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anodized Aluminium Extrusions Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AC Anodization</li><li>DC Anodization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anodized Aluminium Extrusions are categorized into two main types: AC Anodization and DC Anodization. AC Anodization involves using alternating current to create a uniform oxide layer on the surface of the aluminium extrusions, resulting in a corrosion-resistant finish. On the other hand, DC Anodization uses direct current to achieve a thicker and more durable anodized coating, suitable for applications requiring increased wear resistance. Both types offer unique benefits for different end-uses in industries such as construction, automotive, and electronics.</p></p>
