<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Jet Engine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low-Pressure Turbine</li><li>High-Pressure Turbine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The commercial jet engine market can be divided into two main types based on turbine design: low-pressure turbine and high-pressure turbine. Low-pressure turbines are larger and generate power from exhaust gases after they pass through the engine. They are essential for providing the majority of a jet engine's thrust. In contrast, high-pressure turbines are smaller and operate at higher temperatures and speeds, playing a crucial role in compressing air and facilitating fuel combustion within the engine.</p></p>
