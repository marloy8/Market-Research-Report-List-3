<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mobile C-arm X-ray Tubes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stationary Anode</li><li>Rotating Anode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mobile C-arm X-ray tubes are used in medical imaging systems for procedures such as fluoroscopy and angiography. There are two main types of X-ray tubes: stationary anode and rotating anode. In stationary anode tubes, the target material remains fixed while in rotating anode tubes, the target material spins rapidly to dissipate heat generated during X-ray production. Rotating anode tubes are typically used in high-performance systems requiring frequent and prolonged use, while stationary anode tubes are more common in lower power systems.</p></p>
