<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ABS Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Emulsion Graft Copolymerization</li><li>Bulk Copolymerization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>ABS market can be divided into two main types: Emulsion Graft Copolymerization and Bulk Copolymerization. Emulsion Graft Copolymerization involves grafting a rubber phase onto a styrene-acrylonitrile matrix in an emulsion process, resulting in ABS with improved impact strength and heat resistance. On the other hand, Bulk Copolymerization involves polymerizing styrene and acrylonitrile in bulk, followed by grafting with rubber in a separate step, allowing for greater control over the properties of the final ABS product.</p></p>
