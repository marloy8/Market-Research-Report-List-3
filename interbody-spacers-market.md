<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Interbody Spacers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polyetheretherketone</li><li>Titanium</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Interbody spacers are surgical devices used to restore height and alignment of the spine. There are two main types of materials used in these spacers - Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and Titanium. PEEK spacers are lightweight, radiolucent, and have a similar modulus of elasticity to bone, making them suitable for fusion procedures. Titanium spacers, on the other hand, are known for their strength and durability. Both materials have their own advantages and are widely used in the interbody spacers market for various spinal surgeries.</p></p>
