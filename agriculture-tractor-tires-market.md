<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agriculture Tractor Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bias-ply Tires</li><li>Radial-ply Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Agriculture tractor tires are classified into two main types: bias-ply tires and radial-ply tires. Bias-ply tires are made with multiple layers of nylon cords angled diagonally across the tire, providing high durability and resistance to punctures. On the other hand, radial-ply tires have cord plies that run perpendicular to the direction of travel, offering better flexibility and traction. Each type of tire has its own advantages and is suited for different agricultural applications, depending on factors such as soil type and terrain.</p></p>
