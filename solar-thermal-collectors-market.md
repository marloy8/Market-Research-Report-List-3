<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Thermal Collectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flat Plate Collectors</li><li>Evacuated Tube Collectors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solar thermal collectors are devices used to convert sunlight into heat energy for various applications. There are two main types of solar thermal collectors on the market: flat plate collectors and evacuated tube collectors. Flat plate collectors are made up of a black metal plate that absorbs sunlight and transfers heat to a fluid running through the collector. Evacuated tube collectors consist of rows of glass tubes containing a metal absorber tube, which provides higher efficiency by reducing heat loss. Both types are popular choices for solar water heating systems and other thermal applications.</p></p>
