<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Resistive Hygrometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Relative Type</li><li>Absolute Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Resistive hygrometers are commonly categorized into two main types - Relative and Absolute. Relative type hygrometers measure the relative humidity in the air, indicating the percentage of moisture present relative to the maximum amount the air can hold at a certain temperature. Absolute type hygrometers, on the other hand, provide a direct measurement of the water vapor content in the air, without being affected by changes in temperature. Both types are widely used in various industries for monitoring and controlling humidity levels.</p></p>
