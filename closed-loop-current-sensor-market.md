<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Closed Loop Current Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Isolated</li><li>Non-Isolated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Closed loop current sensors can be divided into two main types: isolated and non-isolated. Isolated current sensors provide complete electrical isolation between the primary current-carrying conductor and the sensing circuitry, ensuring safety and preventing ground loop issues. Non-isolated current sensors do not offer this level of isolation, but are typically smaller, more cost-effective, and easier to integrate into existing systems. Each type has its own advantages and is used in different applications based on the specific requirements for electrical isolation and system design.</p></p>
