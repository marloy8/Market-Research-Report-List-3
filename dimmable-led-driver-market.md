<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dimmable LED Driver Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)</li><li>Analogue Dimming</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dimmable LED Drivers can be classified into two main types: Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and Analogue Dimming. PWM carries out dimming control by adjusting the duty cycle of the waveform, switching the LED on and off rapidly. This method is efficient and provides precise dimming levels suitable for various applications. On the other hand, Analogue Dimming utilizes a continuous voltage adjustment to control the dimming level smoothly. It is often preferred for its simplicity and compatibility with existing control systems. Both methods offer flexibility and versatility in dimming LED lighting systems.</p></p>
