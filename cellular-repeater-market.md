<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cellular Repeater Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Donor Antenna</li><li>Indoor Antenna</li><li>Signal Amplifier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cellular repeater market consists of three main types: Donor Antenna, Indoor Antenna, and Signal Amplifier. Donor Antennas are installed outside a building to capture and transmit signals to the repeater. Indoor Antennas distribute the amplified signals inside the building. Signal Amplifiers boost weak signals to enhance coverage. Together, these components work to improve cellular signal strength and reception, especially in areas with poor coverage or signal interference. The market for cellular repeaters continues to grow as demand for reliable connectivity increases.</p></p>
